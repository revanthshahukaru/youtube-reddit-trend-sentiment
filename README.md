Here is a basic Introduction to our project– 
# YouTube & Reddit Sentiment Explorer

## 🧠 Introduction
In a world where trends evolve quickly, it's important to understand **how the public reacts** to them across different platforms. This project pulls data from **YouTube** and **Reddit**, analyzes user comments, and leverages **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to summarize public opinion on trending topics.

## 🎯 Aim / Goal
- To analyze trending YouTube video topics
- To compare user sentiment across YouTube and Reddit
- To generate meaningful, human-like summaries using LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o)

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used

- **Streamlit** – For building the interactive web dashboard
- **PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper)** – For extracting Reddit posts & comments
- **YouTube Data API v3** – For pulling trending video metadata and comments
- **VADER Sentiment (nltk)** – For computing sentiment polarity scores of user comments
- **OpenAI API** – For generating LLM summaries based on combined platform discussions
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – For visualizing sentiment distributions
- **pandas** – For cleaning and managing structured data

## 🚀 Project Highlights
- End-to-end data pipeline from API → Sentiment → LLM → Visualization
- Built-in dynamic search across YouTube and Reddit
- Clean visual insights and human-readable commentary powered by GPT-4o
