Cardinal Dolan on significance of Pope Francis dying after Easter,TODAY,"If Dolan had his way we'd get another Ratzinger (Benedict) or JPII both of whom were regressive/conservative/dogmatic and unwelcoming. Francis was a breath of fresh air but was also very cautious not to go too far. I would love to see someone like John XXIII whose Aggiornamento provided some hope for the modern Catholic but which became anathema to the conservatives. The Church has the same unhealthy divisiveness that we are seeing in politics, which is one reason so many have left the church.",0.8364,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aeP6MfCRgM

Who could replace Pope Francis? Experts explain what could happen next,NBC Chicago,"The difference between Christians and Catholics:

The Catholic Church claims that water Baptism is ""necessary for salvation"" (Catechism  980), ""Yet the grace of Baptism delivers no one...""(Catechism 978)

The Catholic Church says one is ""reborn"" (Catechism 980) by the water that ""delivers no one.""

But Jesus said only ""those believing in Him would receive...the Holy Spirit,"" the ""living water.""(John 7:37-39)

Obviously, you have never read Acts 1:4-5? ""[Jesus] said, ‚Äúyou have heard from Me; for John truly baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.‚Äù 

And since water Baptism doesn't deliver anyone from their sins, a Catholic has to go to a sinner (a priest) in order to be ""reconciled with God and with the Church"" in the sacrament of Penance. Penance ""a laborious kind of Baptism"" (sounds like work) is also ""necessary for salvation.""(Catechism  980)

To top that off, the Catholic Church ""a pilgrim now on earth, is [also] necessary for salvation."" (Catechism 846)

And Peter, the so-called first Pope, speaking of ""the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth"" (v.10) said:

""Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.‚Äù(Acts 4:12)

Conclusion: Salvation is only through the ""name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth.""(Acts 4:10)

The Catholic Church, its sacraments (water Baptism and Penance) are NOT ""necessary for salvation.""

Yes, you may have your Church, the so-called ""sole Church of Christ"" (Catechism 816), that says the ""plan of salvation also includes...in the first place...the Muslims,"" (Catechism 841), but Christians have the ""High Priest"" (Hebrews 8:1) and the only ""Mediator"" (Hebrews 9:15), Jesus Christ, the living God.",0.9559,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIwx8-M7Apc

- There's a separate investigation of a woman in Detroit injured and running out of a property called ""Barberry Street"", and the property was discovered to have a vast network of tunnels underneath it.

"Original Movies in 2025: Oops, All Flops!",RedLetterMedia,"Sorry Mike, I'm one of those library people, at least partially. I love movies,  but I never liked theaters even years ago - too expensive, can't pause, not my couch or my snacks. I rarely have more than one streaming service at a time anymore now that they've cracked down on password sharing like I used to do with all of my friends. If they tried to incentivize me to go to the theater by making me wait longer or increasing the price to rent a movie online, I'd just not watch at all and save the money. It's a shame but there's just nothing coming out right now that gets me excited to watch, and I have a backlog of hundreds of movies I either haven't seen or want to rewatch and most of those I already have access to for free. I'm not saying there aren't good movies now but what's the rush? I'm not chronically online so I won't see spoilers, I may as well watch a year or 5 or 10 from now when it's cheap or free.",0.9716,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0Jwv40MkiY

Possible candidates to become Pope have already been discussed | 9 News Australia,9 News Australia,"The late Argentinian Pope , was a Marxist that had as a hobby , Catholicism. A lot of politics and neo Marxists ideology and very little Bible teachings. He encouraged Human Trafficking in the name of humanity , while he was living behind tall , thick walls, encouraged acceptance homosexuality in the name of political compromise. Think about : The late Pope's politics :compromising and accepting homosexuality , but very critic and intolerant of polygamy. Which one is worse ? Physiological and anatomical speaking. I am not for polygamy. But which one is a greater sin in the Bible ? This happens when you put politics and societal fads, first , and Bible teachings , second. The new candidates for papacy , presented in this video, are very bleak and depressing. Exception  maybe the filipino cardinal. The Catholic Church should focus more on child abuses and money laundering, that takes place inside the organization , and less about Climate and other political issues. Think about : When Fake News starts to refer to Catholic Cardinals using political terms, that has no place in Bible, like : ""hard liner"" and "" moderate"" , then it is something very wrong with your organization.

Joel not saying sorry could not be more in Joels character so how is that a bad thing... kinda disingenuous drinker....
Abby tho.. hated her guts for more than half the game, but at the end I did end up understanding her view and motives, empathize would be a strong word but could be used too.. how ever HBO Abby is faaar more flashed out from the start.. BUUUT not being big and buff makes her feel off, just like Ellie, out of place
still tho I think season 2 has a potential to be better than the 1st season",0.9631,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7US7_rtOkJY
"The Last Of Us - Well, They Really Did It",The Critical Drinker,"Cuckman could have course corrected and done something better, but no he refused to listen to the fans and let his hubris get in the way.

"The Last Of Us - Well, They Really Did It",The Critical Drinker,"But wait. They were saying that Abbys physique is nothing special. That this is normal female physique, absolutely achievable by any female without any steroids. Why couldnt they find actress looking like her? What seems to be the problem?

"The Last Of Us - Well, They Really Did It",The Critical Drinker,funny on my twitter timeline 2 hours before it came out Dina was trending. I was assuming she died. I didn't play the games. I knew enough that Joel died but to do it this early is ballsy. I too felt what is left for me to continue watching. I love a good revenge story but according to the game it looks like I won't get that if they follow the game. After episode 3 I'll know if I'll continue or not.,0.7296,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7US7_rtOkJY

"The Last Of Us - Well, They Really Did It",The Critical Drinker,"I feel like they should have instead come up with a ""bridge"" story set between 1 and 2, that could have folded all the Joel and Ellie flashbacks from Part 2 into it. That way, people got another Joel and Ellie father-daughter adventure season that still emotionally progressed their story by ending on the climax of her finding out what he did.

And THEN season 3 could have been focused on Abby and Ellie's revenge stories.",0.4588,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7US7_rtOkJY

"The Last Of Us - Well, They Really Did It",The Critical Drinker,"I thought the siege was the weak part of the episode. 

It had its moments, the dogs were amazing, but there's far too many shots of the main characters just running around as hordes of zombies run past them. 

It's nonsensical.

And you can't say Joel didn't do anything. He killed an unarmed man in the heat of the moment. If the doctor had killed her then fuck yeah, kill the dude. But we was just serving his purpose by a group who was trying to save the world, and Joel knew this to be true. 

You can see it in Pascal's eyes when she tells him who her father was. He didn't argue because he agreed that if he were in her shoes, he'd be doing the same fucking thing.",-0.9071,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7US7_rtOkJY

And lighting on fire a horde of enemies who are running toward your wooden wall might be the worst plan imaginable. There's hundreds of them and running through a wall of fire and somehow the fire never reaches the pile of them at the base of the wall.
