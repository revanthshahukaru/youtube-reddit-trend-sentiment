Weapons | Teaser,Warner Bros.,"So, here's what I could gather from the website:
- 17 kids from around a small town called ""Maybrook"" all simultaneously run out of their homes with their arms out at 2:17am. There were no signs of struggle or force, and there's no explanation. They were all never seen again.
- There's a separate investigation of a woman in Detroit injured and running out of a property called ""Barberry Street"", and the property was discovered to have a vast network of tunnels underneath it. Going off of the website, this investigation ""sparked questions about the property‚Äôs history and potential connection to unsolved disappearances dating back decades"".

Possible candidates to become Pope have already been discussed | 9 News Australia,9 News Australia,"The late Argentinian Pope , was a Marxist that had as a hobby , Catholicism. A lot of politics and neo Marxists ideology and very little Bible teachings. He encouraged Human Trafficking in the name of humanity , while he was living behind tall , thick walls, encouraged acceptance homosexuality in the name of political compromise. Think about : The late Pope's politics :compromising and accepting homosexuality , but very critic and intolerant of polygamy. Which one is worse ? Physiological and anatomical speaking. I am not for polygamy. But which one is a greater sin in the Bible ? This happens when you put politics and societal fads, first , and Bible teachings , second. The new candidates for papacy , presented in this video, are very bleak and depressing. Exception  maybe the filipino cardinal. The Catholic Church should focus more on child abuses and money laundering, that takes place inside the organization , and less about Climate and other political issues. Think about : When Fake News starts to refer to Catholic Cardinals using political terms, that has no place in Bible, like : ""hard liner"" and "" moderate"" , then it is something very wrong with your organization. You left the realm of Spirituality and enter in the Temporal one.",-0.9775,0.0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jzVYoBUAoo

"The Last Of Us - Well, They Really Did It",The Critical Drinker,"Look, you‚Äôre entitled to feel angry that Joel died (again). That‚Äôs the point of the narrative. But, if you demand uncompromised realism in the game and show, then I implore you to consider the motivation behind this decision. 

Joel is a brutal survivalist. He admits in the first game to basically murdering innocent people to survive. He finds redemption and purpose in Ellie. As the gamer, you are forced into his perspective, and killing the doctor was necessary to protect his surrogate daughter. But what does that look like from the other side? 

A man was murdered for attempting to save the human race. Abby sees Joel as nothing but a cold blooded monster who selfishly kills her family and comrades to protect one person rather than possibly putting an end to the literal apocalypse. 

The parallel narrative of Abby and Ellie is designed to give you an extension of yourself in Ellie (unrelenting desire for revenge) and also to force you to spend time with someone you hate so that you might open yourself up to her motivations and challenge your idea of who the ‚Äúhero‚Äù is. Whether or not the game is successful in that is up to you, hence the choice you are given at the end.

"The Last Of Us - Well, They Really Did It",The Critical Drinker,"I find it really strange that they combined two climactic sequences in one episode, and also so early in the season! The pacing with this show is so all over the place. I haven't even had a chance to remember why I care about either Ellie or Joel before they throw in so much conflict. This episode gave no space to breathe, no moment to actually connect with the characters. Ellie's character has been nothing but petulant and annoying, so why would I be invested now in the rest of the season? Also Tommy and Maria do not have the charisma or emotional drive to carry any of this show. I think that battle sequence was WASTED on them. 

If I were to write this show, I would have the battle sequence happen in episode two, but include Joel and Ellie in it. Use it as a scenario that will help us understand the conflict between them. Make the stakes feel incredibly high, allow us to remember why we care about these characters. I would NOT waste time on this Eugene character that only took me out of the story and distracted us from the real plot. Use that screen time to actually explore Joel and Ellie - the characters we know and should care about. Have Joel die in episode 3, but for the love of god, why blend it with this battle sequence?

I like the clarity and range you have in your mic. I feel like I should get a Lewitt tube microphone but I can't try one out anywhere.  Mainly because I use a tube amp for my guitar and I can't beat the clarity and range for that.
