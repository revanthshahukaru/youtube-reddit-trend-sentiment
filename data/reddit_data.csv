That kid is a menace, and parents are on the hook financially for whatever their dumb kids do.

Your relationship with your family has already taken a hit, so I understand why you’re concerned about souring it even further.  Stop trying to text your family for a moment.

Before heading to small claims court, collect up your evidence: purchase receipts for the damaged items, photographs of the damage, and screenshot downloads of what replacements costs from various online retailers (because what you paid originally might not be enough with the new trade war going on).  Include the texts showing your sister refusing to take responsibility for her child’s damages, and your parents and brother’s blaming you for “allowing” her child to trash your stuff.  To go above and beyond, price out local hotels in your area, showing what a night in a hotel or respectable motel would have cost your sister had she gone that route, instead.  If your parents and/or brother live in the area, as well, include a map of the distance from your sister’s place to one of their homes, showing she could have easily stayed with one of them.  Make FIVE additional copies of your evidence file, keeping the original in a safe place.

Attempt to set up a meeting with your sister, and with your extended family if they are in the area.  If they agree to meet, present your sister, your parents, and your brother each with their own copy of your evidence file.  Tell them that you don’t want to take Sister to court, but that you did her a favor, and in exchange she allowed her child to trash your expensive equipment.  You shouldn’t have to pay for **her** mistake.  If they, the other adults in the family, want to shoulder the replacement costs between them, then there will be no need for small claims court.  

If they all expect you to shoulder the costs alone for *doing your sister a favor*, tell them you will secure a lawyer and add the legal fees and damages for the harassment that they have committed. 

Their response will be whatever it is, and it might get very ugly.  Remain calm and do not raise your voice, leave if they start being unreasonable.

You’ll have your answer.  If they see the extent of the damage and your sister pays up (or the rest of the family chips in to help), then you’ll get your replacements and everything will eventually blow over.  

If they dig their heels in and start calling you names, then it’s time for the lawyer.","nor

They are a handful. When they come to visit, they make a mess, mind you, their parents bring toys and other stuff for the kids to play with. They wake up on time with the kids, they parent well. If the kids are acting up, they get time out. They allow ""exploring"" but to an extent. The kids' father is also a software engineer and knows the importance of electronics and the expenses tied to them. 

Your sister should have: 
1) Gotten up with her child.
2) Be prepared for less sleep for one night as you're doing the favor of providing a space. 
3) respected your space as, again, you're providing. 

In my opinion, if you've set the boundary of ""this room is off limits,"" it should be respected. 

Could you have prevented the little demon from entering the room while unsupervised? Probably. However, you live alone, and this isn't too priority, nor are you used to this circumstance. On top of that, mom (your sister) was present. 

I'm 100% on your side with this. Parents are responsible for their kids' actions (at this young of an age) and this could have been avoided had she got up on time or have other parental measures put in place, regardless of whether they are ""exploring"" or destroying. 

I am also family oriented, and I know taking one's family member to court may or will ruin the relationship, either for a little or forever. 

Perhaps your sister could borrow the money from your parents and pay them back slowly? Or explore a couple of other options? 

I do feel for you. I feel for your sister too (except her reaction). You need to weigh the pros and cons on the outlook of taking her to court.

Anyway, I thought I would also highlight some of my favorites that I've read so far here, because the list above might be overwheming:

* ***Baker Thief*** **by Claudie Arseneault** (fantasy mystery) This is a great book if you want a story that goes deeper into specifically aro experiences in a way I don't see done a lot. Just as a word of warning, the plot isn't necessarily the strongest and the ending does go off the rails a bit, but the rep is certainly worth it imo.
* K**.A. Cook's short stories**: most have aro representation in them (rep is typically put in the description on hir website if there's any), including plenty of the best allo aro rep I've ever read, along with some aro aces and aros with unlabeled sexualities. These are really great if you want short exploration of specific aro experiences, often addressing topics I haven't seen anyone else come close to doing. They can mostly be read online for free (for example,[ here's a link](https://aroworlds.com/fiction/collections/bones-of-green-and-hearts-of-gold/) to one collection)
* ***The Thread that Binds*** **by Cedar McCloud** : This is such a fun cozy fantasy book with deeper themes about trauma and cutting out toxic people from your life even as you form a new found family. It's also really interesting to read as a queernorm book where I can tell the author was also thinking about how to be inclusive to a-spec people as well. (It also has interesting nonbinary representation).
* **The Silt Verses written by Jon Ware and produced by Muna Hussen:** This is great if you want dark fantasy with great character work and great voice acting. The aromanticism of one of the leads is established relatively early on in season one. It's not super relevant to the rest of the audiodrama, but I always appreciate the focus on non-romantic and non-sexual relationships that carry through the rest of the story.
* **Colleen the Wanderer by Raymond St. Elmo**: I'm not sure how deliberate the aro rep in here is—but the MC does very much not want to get married and doesn't seem interested in people that way at all, so I decided to count it. This is great if you want a MC who is very introverted and nonpartnering, but is definitely ok with being alone together with other strange people. It also has a really fun offbeat prose style and some great side characters.
* **Fire Becomes Her by Rosiee Thor**: This book's writing style isn't really my favorite, but I really like how it tackles amatonormativity (especially with a demiromantic character—I don't typically see that a lot). I'm going to stay vague to avoid spoilers though.
* **Sea Foam and Silence by Dove Cooper**: So I love a good cozy aro fairytale retelling, and this was no exception. The MC did come across as being a tad bit infantilized (I think that also just goes with the Little Mermaid retelling bit, ngl) but it was still sweet in general. I also liked the little emoticons the author used—they worked surprisingly well with the verse novel style.","ill also mention here this subs book club is reading a book with arospec representation in it this monthcompound fracture by andrew joseph white

* *Beyond the Black Door* by AM Strickland: (YA fantasy) heteroromantic/demiro ace MC. A girl can walk into other people’s dreams, but she keeps seeing a mysterious black door there. It seems like bad news, but will she open it anyway? This book does have a more ""learning that you are asexual arc"" that I thought was pretty well handled (she even learns about a basic version of the split attraction model), but it's also sometimes a bit edgy in a YA sort of way, which might be a pro or a con for you.
* *The Meister of Decimen City* by Brenna Raney: (superhero) questioning grey-romantic asexual MC. A quasi-supervillain had to deal with being under government surveillance, taking care of her sentient dinosaur children, and stopping her much more evil twin brother. This has another questioning plot line, but different in most in that the MC is an adult and is more sex-indifferent. It's overall a fun/kind of campy portrayal of superheroes but with surprisingly nuanced themes and depictions of trauma as well. It's the best super hero book I've ever read, imo.
* *At the Feet of the Sun* by Victoria Goddard (Book 2 in the Lays of the Hearth-Fire series): (cozy fantasy) ace-spec MC. A bureaucrat has a very eventful retirement. So this is the second book in a series where the first book is pretty long, so normally I wouldn't list it here, but I feel like the a-spec rep was doing enough interesting things I hadn't seen before that I could recommend it. (It's also one of my favorite fantasy books of all time, so I'm not exactly unbiased.) There are cons, like this series can be somewhat repetitive and a bit preachy at times (especially in book 1), but Goddard is really good at character work and writing scenes that emotionally connect to the reader.
* *The Thread that Binds* by Cedar McCloud : (cozy fantasy) aro ace and alloromantic ace MCs; greyromantic and demisexual demiromantic side characters. Three employees at a magic library become part of a found family and learn to cut toxic people out of their lives. This is such a fun cozy fantasy book with deeper themes about trauma and cutting out toxic people from your life even as you form a new found family. It's also really interesting to read as a queernorm book where I can tell the author was also thinking about how to be inclusive to a-spec people as well. (It also has interesting nonbinary representation).
* *The Bone People* by Keri Hulme: (literary with some magical realism elements) aro ace MC. A lonely artist becomes friends with a Maori man and his non-verbal adopted son. (Content warning: explicit and somewhat controversial depictions child abuse) This is the most literary of all the a-spec books I've read (meaning it won the Booker prize type of literary). It has a somewhat experimental style that won't work for everyone, but if you like that sort of thing, this might be a good option. The a-spec rep isn't a huge focus, but it's probably the best depiction of someone knowing they're aro ace without having the words for it and searching for an a-spec community while not being able to find it at the time I've ever read, which makes sense, because that’s the position the author was in when she wrote it in 1984
